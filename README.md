About
-----

Medic OS is a size-optimized Linux-based operating system, designed specifically
for Medic Mobile's distributed web applications. It currently runs on VMware,
VirtualBox, Hyper-V, Xen (including Amazon EC2 and Openstack), and Linux
chroot/container environments. A port for ARM v6 and ARM v7 machines (such
as the Raspberry Pi and Beaglebone Black) is in progress.

Medic OS provides a Busybox-based userspace environment, Erlang runtime,
CouchDB, Node.js, OpenSSH, a Java runtime environment, couchdb-lucene, Gammu,
gammu-json, and a number of other smaller utilities and modules. The full
compressed Medic OS distribution is less than one hundred megabytes.
